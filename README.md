# Dog Mange Detection using Artificial Intelligence

This is a project for detecting dog mange using artificial intelligence. The project consists of a frontend that interacts with an API to perform the detection.

## How It Works

The project is divided into two parts: the frontend and the API.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed in JavaScript and uses the React framework. It is responsible for providing the user interface to interact with the dog mange detection functionality. To start the frontend, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can check by typing `node --version` in the terminal. If Node.js is not installed, you will need to install it first.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the frontend:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will start and be accessible in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### API

The API is developed in JavaScript and uses the Express.js framework. It is responsible for receiving requests from the frontend and sending the information to the Python API that performs the dog mange detection using artificial intelligence. To start the API, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can check by typing `node --version` in the terminal. If Node.js is not installed, you will need to install it first.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `src/database` directory of the project.

3. Run the following command to install the API dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the API:

   ```
   node src/database/Express.js
   ```

   The API will start and be ready to receive requests from the frontend.
```
```
